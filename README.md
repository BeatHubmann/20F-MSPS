## Course synopsis

The goals of this course are
* a) understanding the fundamentals of the electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, and coupled field simulations and
* b) performing effective simulations of primary equipment of electric power systems. The course is understood complementary to 227-0537-00L "Technology of Electric Power System Components", but can also be taken separately.

## Objective
The student should learn the fundamentals of the electromagnetic, thermal, mechanical, and coupled fields simulations necessary for modern product development and research based on virtual prototyping. She / he should also learn the theoretical background of the finite element method (FEM) and its application to low- and high-frequency electromagnetic field simulation problems. The practical exercises of the course should be done by using one of the commercially available field simulation software (Infolytica, ANSYS, and / or COMSOL). After completing the course the student should be able to properly and efficiently use the software to simulate practical design problems and to understand and interpret the obtained results.
